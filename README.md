I'm Andrew Tran, a dynamic Full Stack Developer whose path veered from pre-dental studies to leading-edge tech innovation. My early engagement with dentistry unveiled a keen interest in how technology can streamline daily life. Armed with a Psychology degree from UC Davis, I transitioned into the tech realm, refining my skills at Coding Dojo. Here, I embraced a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, notably the MERN stack, Java, and Python.

My approach to development is comprehensive, blending the meticulousness honed during my dental studies with a zeal for creating user-centric, intuitive digital solutions. This methodology is greatly influenced by my psychology background, allowing me to forge digital experiences that deeply resonate with users.

**Key Strengths:**

- **Innovative Tech Problem Solver**: Proficient in leading initiatives to enhance user accessibility and interfaces, utilizing my coding expertise for impactful outcomes.
- **Precision and Detail-Oriented**: My dedication to detail, nurtured in dental studies, ensures excellence and thoroughness in coding and development projects.
- **User-Focused Designer**: Informed by my psychology studies, I'm adept at developing intuitive, user-centered solutions.
- **Flexible and Rapid Learner**: Demonstrated capability to pivot between careers and swiftly acquire new competencies, easily adapting to diverse programming languages and technological frameworks.

Motivated by a desire to bridge the gap between technology and everyday people, I strive to render the digital landscape more accessible and relatable. Currently on the lookout for entry-level Full Stack Developer roles, I'm eager to bring my distinct blend of technical prowess and insight into human behavior to a team that values creativity and empathetic web solutions. I'm excited about embracing new challenges and am dedicated to ongoing growth and refinement through feedback.
