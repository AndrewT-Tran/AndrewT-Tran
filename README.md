## About Me

My journey in technology began uniquely with pre-dental studies, but it sparked my interest in how technology can enhance our daily lives. After earning my Psychology degree from UC Davis, I switched to technology and sharpened my skills at Coding Dojo. I explored various programming languages and frameworks such as MERN, Java, and Python. My approach to development combines my meticulous focus from dental studies with my strong commitment to creating user-friendly and intuitive tech solutions. This unique blend, along with my psychology insights, helps me create digital experiences that resonate with people.
